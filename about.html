        <p>              Hey, assalamualaikum! Greetings from my personal self-reporting blog.
             My aim in creating this blog is to provide a self-description and to briefly discuss my life's path. Ever wondered what motivates me, Afrah Amani? I apologise; I believe I was a little too thrilled and neglected to introduce myself.
              My parents gave me a name that is a little different from others', and you have probably never heard of it before. I am <b>Nur Afrah Amani Binti Mohd Zulfahmin</b>. Isn't it pretty lengthy? Hehe.Just so you know, I'm not your typical twentysomething. 
              I am a force to be reckoned with. I seem to look older than my years, at least to those that observe me. If you never met me before, just picture this: a determined person who likes to talk, an ambitious soul with a heart full of dreams, and a person who likes freedom.
               Yeah, that's none other than me. As someone who wears spectacles, let me tell you something. I wasn't born short-sighted, but when I was thirteen, I started playing phone games in the dark because I believed people with glasses were incredibly cool and intelligent. 
               This is what caused my eyesight to become short. rather stupid, isn't it? Hehehe.My family was my pillar of support and affection throughout my childhood, offering me unwavering love and encouragement.
             I grew up with typical Asian parents who had their own love language and did not really shower me with money, hugs, or romantic phrases like those parents in the West. They are quite firm with me and will frequently scold me out of love instead of giving me hugs. 
                They don't lavish me with money; instead, they teach me how to work hard for what I want. They want me to understand the value of money and to have worked hard .We may have our share of cheerful chaos, but it's those heartwarming connections that make our family truly special.
             Allow me to introduce you to my wonderful siblings and the close-knit family we all belong to. Being the eldest of five siblings, I was privileged to lead by example and pave the way for my siblings. My one and only younger brother is the last of my three younger sisters.
             For the record, I am sixteen years older than him. The twins that are third and fourth are seven years apart from me, and the second is only a year apart.</p>
        
        
         <p>            Alright, let's switch gears and move on from the family talk. Let's embark on a journey through my life, starting from kindergarten, middle school, and high school! I attended Tabika Kemas when I was four and five years old, then Qiraati Al-Hidayah till I was six years old. 
            A naturally curious child, I was constantly ready to learn new things and meet new people. I'm a really nice child who is quite manageable. I never throw a fit when I want to go to school, so my mum only needs to put in a little more effort on my behalf.
             I need you to give me credit for that!Middle school was where I attended SK Dato' Hashim 2. Despite the difficulties I faced in middle school, I was able to discover my love for painting and find comfort in using my artistic expression. I'm aware that I'm talented at painting and drawing, but I hated colouring. 
             Back then, I painted as a hobby and found it to be quite enjoyable. I'm not the smartest person among my pals, but I'm not completely stupid either. In the end, I attended SMK Pengkalan Chepa 2 in high school, which is next to my middle school, and we were divided by a common field.
              I embraced opportunities to grow academically and socially, making lasting memories with my friends.What do you think? I was a complete failure. My academic achievements are astounding, and I'm so happy that all of my hard work has paid off! 
              I received 10 A's and 1B for PT3, 6 A's and 2B+ and 1C+ for my SPM, and all A's for my UPSR. Thank you very much for everything.</p>
        
        <p>               For sure! My trip to matriculation served as a springboard for my time at university. I have a particular place in my heart for Matriculation Kelantan, where I attended. From there, I learned a great deal of stuff. Meeting plenty of friends from a different state when I was living independently away from home for the first time taught me a lot about their language and culture. 
            I completed my matriculation well, earning a 3.92 CGPA in my second semester and a 4.00 CGPA in my first. I had the chance to continue my education for a degree in business administration with a marketing concentration when I was nineteen years old. Though it deviates somewhat from my actual accounting course, I think Allah's has a more suitable plan for me.<ITALIC></ITALIC></p>
